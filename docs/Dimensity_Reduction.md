## Big Data Visualization

- When dimensionaly large -> reduction = learning a latent.

### Feature Elimination

- Mapping data point to a straight-line or linear line.
- Choose the line follow: the data points nearest the line.
    - Minimize the reconstruction of the projection
    - Maximize the variance of the projections.
        - Variance large more keep data more.
        - Using PCA model (Principal Component Analysis). To be consistent, we will constain principal components...


### Reconstruction Error
